        Shadow DOM introduces a new kind of node that can be associated with elements, this is called a shadow root. An element that
        has a shadow root associated with it is known as a shadow host. When an element is a shadow host, the content of
        the shadow root is rendered instead of the content of the host element. Lets take a look at a simple example.
        <br />
        <br /> This basically means that the shadow host's content regardless of it's current state will get replaced by
        the content provided by the shadow root. It's important to note that we shouldn't use any content within our shadow root since this content is invisible by Search Engines
        <br />
        <br /> Make sure to have "Show user agent shadow DOM" option enabled in Chrome Developer Tools to see how shadow
        host's original content (Star Trek) get's replaced by Star Wars.

    <h1>Star Trek</h1>
    <script>
        var host = document.querySelector("h1");
        var root = host.createShadowRoot();
        root.textContent = "Star Wars";
    </script>
